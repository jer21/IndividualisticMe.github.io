    	<h2> My job </h2>
        	<p> I work as a professional coffee taster and taste everything from commercial instant coffee to high grade artisan coffee <em>(mostly the latter)</em>. </p> 
            
            <p> To me, coffee is a way of life and it inspires my soul. I can never start my day without a cup of coffee. Talk to me before my coffee, and you won't get a good vibe. That's how <strong> important</strong> it is to me. My favorite coffee place is this underground cafe you probably don't know about (and I'm not telling you so it doesn't become mainstream!) and they serve <strong> artisan coffee only</strong>. My favorite order here is the "organic, gluten free soy cappuccino with no foam". </p>
            
            <p>Here, you can find some of my coffee chronicles, where I post coffee reviews suggested by friends and family. None of them are affiliated with my proffesional reviews that I do for my job. </p>

            <p>This is the organic chai winter solstice latte I got a cafe earlier this week. It is also, <em>importantly </em>, organic. Check out my review in this video below.

            <p class= "solstice"> <strong><em> Tanzanian Coffee </em></strong>
            <p> As part of my job, I got to fly to Tanzania recently to review more coffee. This one is something I tried on my own while exploring the town of Zanzibar. It is handmade by Uncle Babu, a sweet Tanzanian old man that makes coffee traditionally for a living. I watched the entire process, from the removal of coffee beans from the fruit till the roasting of coffee beans in a ceramic pot on fire.

            <img id ="tanzania2" src="Images/pour.JPG"/>
            
            <p> The coffee tasted very pure and rich. It was refreshing because it has no flavors added, unlike the usual coffee I try. It has a very clean finish with no aftertaste whatsoever, which was nice. It was slightly acidic but not sour, which was good. It also had a very smooth and light body. I highly enjoyed the coffee making process, which was very unique because I am sure not many people know what coffee fruit even looks like. So, if you guys ever get to go to Tanzania, try their coffee! </p>
            
            <p class= "solstice"> <strong><em> Mason Jar Coffee Cups </em></strong> </p>
            	<p>I am going to go off tangent here from the regular coffee reviews. I was so excited about the new mason jar that I got (I talked about in my earlier review video) that I made a video of my morning routine of making coffee with it. Using mason jar cups for coffee is sooo unique! It was an old preservative jar that I used to store preserved fruits, which also makes it environmentally friendly! Aren't I creative? Please enjoy this short personal art project of mine. </p>
